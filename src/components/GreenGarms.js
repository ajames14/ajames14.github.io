    <p> My teammate and I decided to focus on our shared interest in sustainable fashion. We built an app, Green Garms, which combines a clothes swap platform and a brand guide, helping users to be more sustainable with their fashion choices.</p>
    <p>This application was created using Python and Django for the back-end and ReactJS on the front. I was primarily responsible for building the clothes swap platform. Writing the logic for this part of the app was challenging, but extremely rewarding â€“ the experience made me realise I really enjoy working on the back-end, teasing apart complex problems and working out how things fit together.</p>
