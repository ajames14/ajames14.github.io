    <p>For our final project on the GA course, my partner and I focused on our shared interest in sustainable fashion. We built a full stack app, Green Garms, combining a clothes swap platform and a brand guide, helping users to be more sustainable with their fashion choices.</p>
    <p>I was responsible for building the clothes swap platform. Writing the logic for this part of the app was challenging, but extremely rewarding â€“ the experience made me realise I really enjoy working on the back-end, teasing apart complex problems and working out how things fit together.</p>
